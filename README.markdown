Potent Potables is a quiz show application based on the concepts of popular television shows.

The software included will allow end-users and developers to build a quiz show server that can 
display the board /quizshow/board, host the show from a console /quizshow/console, and 
buzz in through different mediums using a REST API request or Mobile web UI /quizshow/buzzer.

Potent Potables brings the promise of a quiz-show application that anyone can setup and use. 
Multiple games can run in parallel, if you are to run this on a server.
